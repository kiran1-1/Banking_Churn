# 🏦 Banking Churn Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **customer churn** for a bank using machine learning. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical metric in the banking industry. By predicting which customers are at risk of leaving, banks can take timely actions to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn-related revenue loss.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about bank customers, such as:

- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Geography)
- Bank account details (Credit Score, Balance, Tenure, etc.)
- Product usage (Number of products, Active status)
- Target variable: `Exited` (1 = Churned, 0 = Stayed)

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of churn vs. non-churn
   - Correlation analysis
   - Key churn drivers

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
   - Neural Network (optional)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV
